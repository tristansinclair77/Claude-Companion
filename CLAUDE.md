# Claude Companion — Working Instructions for Claude

## GitHub Push Account

`tristansinclair77`

This repo lives at `tristansinclair77/Claude-Companion`. Commits remain authored
as **Sansflaire** per global rule.

## Aria Character Data Repo

Aria's character data (portraits, emotions, `knowledge.db`, `rpg.db`, config) is
tracked separately at **`tristansinclair77/Aria-WorkPC`** (private).

This repo lives at `characters/default/` inside the companion repo and has its
own `.git`. To sync to another machine: clone it into that path. To push a
snapshot from this machine: close the app, then from `characters/default/` run
`git add -A && git commit -m "sync" && git push`.

**Core rule (mirrored from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`):** Never silently run
`gh auth switch`. If the active account doesn't already equal
`tristansinclair77`, pause and ask for explicit approval before switching —
other Claude Code sessions on this machine may have concurrent pushes mid-flight
that a silent switch would break. Only proceed after a yes.

If the active account already matches, no prompt needed — just push.

## Work Strategy

### Write-First, Verify-Second
Always write ALL source files to disk before doing verification runs. This way, if context
limits are hit, no work is lost. Files on disk are permanent checkpoints.

When resuming, read the existing files to understand current state, then continue from
the right phase.

### Keep RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md Current
After every significant batch of work, update `RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md` so it accurately
reflects the current state of the project. A fresh Claude session should be able to read
that file and immediately know:
- What has been built
- What phase we're on
- What is left to do
- Any known issues or decisions made

### Context Management
- Write files in batches — don't pause to test after each individual file
- Update RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md at natural stopping points (end of a phase)
- Use MEMORY.md for cross-session patterns and preferences
- This project's design docs live at the root:
  - `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` — architecture and phases
  - `CHECKLIST.md` — granular task list
  - `AI_LEARNING.md` — neural brain design
  - `MEMORY_AND_SESSIONS.md` — session and memory system
- System-specific docs live in `docs/`:
  - `docs/VISUAL_PACKAGE_SYSTEM.md` — how Visual Packages work; read this before
    adding or modifying any package, effect, or package-related settings code

### Aria → Claude Code Live Context Sync

This project exposes Aria's live state (personality, master_summary, permanent
memories, current emotional axes, sensation, threads) into every Claude Code
session via an auto-generated `@import` at the top of this CLAUDE.md.

**Components:**

- `scripts/aria-claude-sync.py` — reads `characters/default/knowledge.db`,
  produces a markdown digest at `.claude/aria-context.md`. Subcommands:
  `on`, `off`, `sync`, `status`.
- `.claude/aria-mode.txt` — single-line state file: `on` or `off`.
- `.claude/aria-context.md` — the import target. Contains either the full
  digest (mode=on) or an off-marker comment (mode=off).
- `.claude/settings.json` — SessionStart hook that runs `python … sync` at
  every session start with matcher `startup|resume|clear|compact`.
- `src/main/main.js` — calls `_kickAriaClaudeSync()` as fire-and-forget at
  companion-app boot and immediately after a successful Save Chat, so the
  context file stays fresh between Claude Code sessions.

**One-session lag warning.** The SessionStart hook fires *after* CLAUDE.md is
read, so a regen triggered by the hook only takes effect on the *next* Claude
Code session. The auto-sync from `main.js` (boot + Save Chat) closes that gap
in practice — by the time you switch from the companion to Claude Code, the
file is fresh.

**Maintainer notes:**

- Keep the digest under ~50 KB. It rides in the prompt cache, so first-session
  cost is paid once and amortized — but it still consumes context budget.
- The digest deliberately tells Claude Code **not** to wrap responses in
  `[DIALOGUE]/[THOUGHTS]/(emotion)` — those are companion-app format only.
  In Code, Aria talks like a normal markdown reply.
- If you add a new piece of long-lived Aria state to knowledge.db, decide
  whether it belongs in this digest (i.e. would it change how Aria responds
  in a Claude Code chat?). If yes, extend `build_context()`. If it's just
  archival (full transcripts, FTS index, etc.), leave it out.

### Summarization Refusals on Intimate Content — Use Aria as the Summarizer

**Pattern:** When you (Claude Code) write a one-shot script that calls Haiku/Sonnet
to summarize, extract memories from, or otherwise post-process companion chat
data, and the data may contain intimate / NSFW content — **do not use a generic
"you are a summarizer" system prompt.** The model will refuse and write a
refusal lecture into your output field, which then corrupts master_summary or
permanent_memories.

**Fix:** Reuse `buildSystemPrompt` from [src/shared/system-prompt.js](src/shared/system-prompt.js)
to construct the **full normal Aria system prompt** (character + rules + master_summary
+ permanent_memories), then frame the task as a meta-request from Trist relayed
via Claude Code. Aria's character context establishes her identity and willingness;
that's what makes the same NSFW content flow fine through normal chat. The
summarization task piggybacks on that same identity grounding.

**Reference implementation:** [scripts/aria-summarize-today.js](scripts/aria-summarize-today.js)
+ [scripts/save-todays-chat-aria.py](scripts/save-todays-chat-aria.py). Node helper
builds the Aria system prompt and invokes `claude.exe`; Python orchestrator handles
DB I/O. Use that pair as the template for any future "Aria writes about Aria"
recovery/maintenance work.

**For the in-app save-chat path:** the in-app `summarizeConversation` in
[src/main/claude-bridge.js](src/main/claude-bridge.js) still uses a bare summarizer
prompt and will hit the same refusal on intimate chats. If you touch that file,
switch it to the Aria-context pattern too.

**When NOT to use this pattern:** if the data is purely SFW (e.g. code review,
factual questions, tracker maintenance), the generic summarizer is fine and uses
fewer tokens. Use the Aria-context pattern only when the input might contain
content a vanilla Haiku would refuse on.

### Memory Systems — Three Distinct Stores

Aria has THREE separate memory stores. Do not conflate them when adding features
or extracting/inserting facts:

1. **`permanent_memories` (identity definition)** — facts about who Aria is and
   what she's stated about herself, plus stable facts she's learned about Trist.
   Source flags: `companion_self` for Aria's self-facts, `auto_detected` /
   `auto_updated` for user facts. Written via `[MEMORY]`, `[MEMORY_UPDATE]`,
   `[SELF]` tags. **Persist forever.** This store DEFINES identity — it is not
   a working memory system. Aria sees these as "Permanent Memories" and "What
   You've Told The User About Yourself" in the system prompt.

2. **`short_term_memory` (working — 5-min idle)** — Aria's own in-conversation
   scratchpad for things she wants to hold briefly. Written via `[REMEMBER:short]`.
   Cited via `[RECALL] shrtNNNNN`. Wipes after 5 minutes of not being cited.
   Cited 3+ times → auto-promoted to `long_term_memory`.

3. **`long_term_memory` (working — 7-day idle)** — Aria's own scratchpad for
   things worth carrying across days. Written via `[REMEMBER:long]` or
   auto-promoted from short-term. Cited via `[RECALL] longNNNNN`. Wipes after
   7 days of not being cited.

Both working stores are managed in [src/main/knowledge-db.js](src/main/knowledge-db.js)
(`insertShortMemory`, `insertLongMemory`, `recallMemories`, `promoteShortMemories`,
`cleanupExpiredMemories`) and surfaced into the prompt by the "YOUR WORKING
MEMORY" section in [src/shared/system-prompt.js](src/shared/system-prompt.js).
Lifecycle is driven from [src/main/local-brain.js](src/main/local-brain.js) on
every Claude turn: cleanup → load → send → write back RECALL/REMEMBER → promote.

When building new features that "save what Aria said":
- Permanent identity fact about her or Trist → `permanent_memories` (existing `[SELF]`/`[MEMORY]`).
- Short-lived in-scene context she wants to hold → `short_term_memory`.
- Something worth carrying for days → `long_term_memory`.

### Keep the Help Panel Current
`src/renderer/js/help-panel.js` is the in-app reference manual. It **must always
be kept up-to-date** with every feature in the app.

Rules:
- When adding a new feature, button, setting, or effect → add a corresponding
  article (or update an existing one) in `help-panel.js` in the same PR/batch.
- When removing or renaming a feature → remove or update its article.
- Articles live in the `ARTICLES` array. Each entry needs: `catId`, `id`, `title`,
  `tags[]` (generous with keywords), and `content` (HTML via the `p/kv/ex/sc/chips`
  helpers defined at the top of the file).
- The `tags[]` array is the searchable keyword store — include every synonym,
  abbreviation, and related concept a user might search for.
- If a new category of features is added, add a new entry to `CATEGORIES` as well.

### Keep the Adventure Monster Roster Current
The text-adventure storywriter (Claude) can only spawn monsters whose slugs
appear in `MONSTER_LIST` in [src/main/text-adventure-store.js](src/main/text-adventure-store.js).
Sprite files in [assets/monsters/](assets/monsters/) that aren't in that list
are invisible to Claude — he literally cannot reference them.

**Rule:** Whenever new monster sprites are added (e.g. by running
`scripts/slice-monster-grid.js` after dropping new `ref/monster grid*.png`
sources), `MONSTER_LIST` MUST be updated in the same batch so every PNG in
`assets/monsters/` has a corresponding entry. The reverse also holds: if a
sprite is removed, its `MONSTER_LIST` entry must be removed.

Each entry needs:
- `slug` — must exactly match the PNG filename without extension
- `name` — pretty display label shown to the user / used by Claude in prose
- `difficulty` — integer used by the encounter system; pick a sensible tier
  (roughly: 1=trash, 2=low, 3=mid, 4=high, 5=elite, 6+=boss)

Before committing a monster-related change, sanity-check that every file in
`assets/monsters/*.png` has a `MONSTER_LIST` entry and vice versa — a simple
diff between `fs.readdirSync('assets/monsters')` and `MONSTER_LIST.map(m =>
m.slug + '.png')` should be empty in both directions.

## Project: Claude Companion

### What it is
Electron desktop AI companion app with 1980s/90s anime cyberpunk UI.
Backend: `claude -p` CLI (user's Max plan). Local learning brain routes simple
queries locally; novel queries go to Claude.

### Key Technical Facts
- **Platform**: Windows, Electron 40.x, Node 22.15.0
- **ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1** is set by the VSCode/Claude Code terminal.
  Always launch via `node scripts/launch.js` (which clears this env var).
  `npm start` calls this script.
- **better-sqlite3** requires `electron-rebuild` after install (already done).
- **Claude CLI**: spawned as `claude.cmd -p "<prompt>" --output-format json --system-prompt "<sys>"`
  Every call is a FRESH session — full context (core rules + character + memories + window) is
  injected every time. No `--resume` flag.
- **Response format**: Claude must output `[DIALOGUE]`, `[THOUGHTS]`, `(emotion_id)`, optional `[MEMORY]` lines.
- **19 emotions**: neutral, happy, soft_smile, laughing, confident, smug, surprised, shocked,
  confused, thinking, concerned, sad, angry, determined, embarrassed, exhausted, pout, crying, lustful_desire
- **3-tier brain router**: Filler (instant JSON) → Local (SQLite FTS5 + Jaccard) → Claude CLI
- **Source indicator**: FILLER ● (green) / LOCAL ● (orange) / CLAUDE ● (cyan) in title bar
